# Sorting Visualizer
This is a sorting visualizer project that provides a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

The project is developed using C++ and SFML library, which allows us to create graphics, handle user input, and visualize the sorting algorithms in real-time.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the command git clone https://github.com/Sewder/Sorting-Visualizer.git.

Open the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Install the SFML library by following the instructions in the SFML-README.md file located in the project directory.

Compile and run the project using a C++ compiler.
## Usage
To use the sorting visualizer:

Launch the program by running the executable file.

Choose a sorting algorithm from the list of available algorithms.

Watch the sorting process in real-time.
## Contributing
